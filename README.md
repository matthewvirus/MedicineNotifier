# Medicine Notifier

### My diploma project

#### Prelude

Hello, I'm Matthew, the student in MREC (BSUIR affiliate). This is my diploma project (yes, diploma project in opensource xD). Here I will write all about my application, GH for me is something like journal where I can describe my successes and failures, where my progress can be documented. I hope this project will be alive not only in my hands, but in Greate OpenSourcers hands too.

#### Description

Now this application can notify about your medications.<br>
There are four notification modes in the app:
<ul>
  <li>One time per day</li>
  <li>Two times per day</li>  
  <li>Three times per day</li>  
  <li>Four time per day</li>  
</ul>
